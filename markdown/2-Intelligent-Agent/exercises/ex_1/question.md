Suppose that the performance measure is concerned with just the first
$T$ time steps of the environment and ignores everything thereafter.
Show that a rational agent’s action may depend not just on the state of
the environment but also on the time step it has reached.


A rational agent’s actions may depend on both the state of the environment and the time step when the performance measure evaluates only the first $T$ time steps This is because the time constraint influences the relevance of future outcomes, making actions that yield long-term benefits less favorable as the agent approaches $T$.For example, an agent near the $T$-th step will prioritize immediate rewards over actions that require more time to produce results, even if the latter would be optimal in an unrestricted timeframe. Thus, the agent’s decisions are shaped not only by the current state but also by the diminishing opportunities tied to the remaining time steps.

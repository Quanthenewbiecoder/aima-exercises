Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation.

because goals define the desired outcomes and provide a clear direction for identifying relevant problems. Problem formulation risks addressing irrelevant or less impactful issues without clear goals, leading to wasted effort and misaligned solutions. Goals are benchmarks for evaluating whether the framed problem and its solutions align with the intended objectives, ensuring strategic focus and stakeholder alignment. By starting with goals, problem formulation becomes purposeful and directly contributes to achieving the desired results
